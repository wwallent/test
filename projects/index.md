## Ocean Worlds Reconnaissance and Characterization of Astrobiological Analogs

{% capture text %}
Ocean Worlds Reconnaissance and Characterization of Astrobiological Analogs (ORCAA), funded by NASA’s Planetary Science and Technology through Analog Research (PSTAR) program, is an effort to advance our understanding of Earth’s cryosphere while developing science operations and technology to employ in the search for life beyond Earth. ORCAA utilizes the Juneau Icefield (Alaska, USA) as an analog feature for the ice shells of ocean worlds like Jupiter’s moon Europa, and will deploy a cryobot called the Ice Diver in 2025 in order to access and sample a subglacial lake beneath 300 meters of ice. This field campaign will simulate future deployment and operation of an autonomous cryobot on an icy ocean world, and will add to the extremely limited global inventory of directly sampled subglacial lakes.
