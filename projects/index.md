# Subice Exploration
Icy moons, such as Europa and Enceladus, are believed to host vast oceans capped by a thick layer of ice and are prime astrobiological targets for future exploration. Many mission concepts to these worlds involve a probe that can melt through the ice to sample the subsurface ocean for evidence of life. Before any mission can be launched, the probes must be rigorously field tested.

## Ocean Worlds Reconnaissance and Characterization of Astrobiological Analogs

{% capture text %}
Ocean Worlds Reconnaissance and Characterization of Astrobiological Analogs (ORCAA), funded by NASA’s Planetary Science and Technology through Analog Research (PSTAR) program, is an effort to advance our understanding of Earth’s cryosphere while developing science operations and technology to employ in the search for life beyond Earth. ORCAA utilizes the Juneau Icefield (Alaska, USA) as an analog feature for the ice shells of ocean worlds like Jupiter’s moon Europa, and will deploy a cryobot called the Ice Diver in 2025 in order to access and sample a subglacial lake beneath 300 meters of ice. This field campaign will simulate future deployment and operation of an autonomous cryobot on an icy ocean world, and will add to the extremely limited global inventory of directly sampled subglacial lakes.

## Mt. Meager
{% capture text %}
Mount Meager, a glacial volcanic complex in  the Coast Mountains of British Columbia, Canada, characterized by active fumaroles that carve dynamic cave systems through overlying glacier ice, creating volatile microhabitats with dangerously high concentrations of gasses such as hydrogen sulfide and carbon dioxide within the caves.

# Brines
text about how cool brines are

## Don Juan Pond
{% capture text %}
Life as we know it requires liquid water; beyond Earth, liquid water is likely present as hypersaline brines. Using bacteria isolated from hypersaline Antarctic environments like Don Juan Pond and Blood Falls, we are interrogating specific adaptations in cold- and salt-tolerant organisms that could allow for survival on other planets.

# Microbial Extremophiles
Microbial life can respond to environmental perturbation through the production of specialized molecules (secondary metabolites). These compounds can protect cells from environmental stressors (e.g., pigments reducing UV stress), or mediate interactions with other community members (e.g., antibiotics). We investigate how environmental stressors impact the production of these compounds to understand the impacts of climate change on Antarctic communities.
