My name is Walker Perrin, and I am a senior majoring in Biochemistry with a Pre-med concentration. While my long-term goal is to become a medical doctor, I am currently excited to be conducting research that combines two of my favorite subjects: biology and astronomy. The Antarctic region is fascinating due to its thin ozone layer, which allows higher levels of UV radiation to reach the surface, creating an extreme environment similar to what might be found on other planets and moons like Mars or Europa, respectively. In previous research, I have explored how UVA radiation affects the metabolic and genomic features of Arthrobacter sp. strain FRX14, a microbe isolated from near Lake Fryxell, a permanently ice-covered lake in the McMurdo Dry Valleys of Antarctica. Currently, I am expanding this research to include UVB radiation and other microbial species. The goal of my work is to better understand how extremophiles survive these intense conditions and explore how microbial adaptations to high-UV environments might mimic potential life on other planets. Feel free to contact me if you have any further questions!
