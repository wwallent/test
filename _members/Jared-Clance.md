Jared earned his B.S. in biological sciences from UTK in 2020, and his M.S. in earth & planetary science from the University of New Mexico in 2022. He is currently a PhD student studying glacial systems as analogue features for icy ocean worlds like Europa in the ongoing search for life outside of Earth. His current projects are based in polyextreme ecosystems at a glaciovolcanic system at Mt. Meager (British Columbia, Canada) and the Juneau Icefield (Alaska, USA).
