Will Wallentine is a PhD student in the Mikucki lab, where he researches life in extreme environments. 
Heâ€™s broadly interested in adaptation mechanisms in cold and chaotropic environments and how that knowledge can be applied to the search for life on Mars. 
Currently, his research is focused on exploring membrane lipid modifications in bacteria isolated from a cold and salty environment called Don Juan Pond (DJP). 
DJP is nearly saturated with CaCl2, a chaotropic salt which excels at destabilizing membranes. However, when some bacteria are grown in cold temperatures, 
they are able to tolerate higher concentrations of CaCl2 and simultaneously grow in colder temperatures with more CaCl2 exposure. 
This synergism may have enabled life to thrive on early Mars, which is understood to have had conditions similar to those found at DJP.
By studying how bacteria adapt to DJP-like conditions and what kind of lipids they produce, we can build a better understanding of what 
life might have been like on Mars and how to look for evidence of it.
