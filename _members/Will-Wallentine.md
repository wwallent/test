Will Wallentine is a PhD student in the Mikucki lab, where he researches life in extreme environments. 
Heâ€™s broadly interested in adaptation mechanisms in cold and chaotropic environments and how that knowledge can be applied to the search for life on Mars. 
Currently, his research is focused on exploring membrane lipid modifications in bacteria isolated from a cold and salty environment called Don Juan Pond (DJP).
